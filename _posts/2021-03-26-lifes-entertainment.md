Everything in our life is temporary and passes along our eyes. Every time sky beginning to rain, it finally stops. We always get to fix, when we get hurt. Every morning sun rising tells you that brightness always take the place of darkness, but usually you forget about it.

So if the situation is fine, just enjoy it, because the situation changes along the time. Additionally if the situation is bad, it never remains in your life too. Decide to laugh for no reason more, sing more, dance more. You have to be enthusiastic for doing anything.

Don't stop because of frightening. Do you think death is the worth event? The death is not as worth as you think. Actually the worth fact is the more you continue to live, the more you lose your hope and feel to die.
